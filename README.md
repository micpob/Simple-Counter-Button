# Simple Counter Button

This was my first Chrome extension. I needed a counter that could be incremented by clicking on a **button on the browser’s toolbar**. 
Surprisingly, I couldn’t find such an extension in the Chrome Web Store, so I made this one.

<br/>
<div align="center" >
  <img src="Docs/Screenshots/simple_counter_button.PNG" alt="Simple Counter Button screenshot 1" width="375px">
</div>
<br/>

The counter can be set to step by any value, positive or negative. Default step is +1 per click.

The counter also has a **notification functionality**: it is possible to set a limit and receive a notification when that limit is reached.

<br/>
<div align="center" >
  <img src="Docs/Screenshots/simple_counter_button_notification.PNG" alt="Simple Counter Button screenshot notification" width="450px">
</div>
<br/>

Right click on the button and select “Options” to access the options page.
