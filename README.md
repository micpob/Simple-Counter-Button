# Simple Counter Button

This is my first Chrome extension. I needed a counter that could be incremented by clicking on a **button on the browser’s toolbar**. 
Surprisingly, I couldn’t find such extension in the Chrome Web Store, so I made this one.

<div align="center" >

</div>

The counter can be set to step by any value, positive or negative. Default step is +1 per click.

The counter also has a **notification functionality**: it is possible to set a limit and receive a notification when that limit is reached.

</div>

Right click on the button and select “Options” to access the options page.
